# Object-Oriented-Programming-for-Software-students.
Anthony Huber -- *Southwest Technical College* -- **Object Oriented Programming for Software Students**
<br>
The purpose of this repository is to hold the changes and completed projects that I will be doing for OOP 
<br>
I am a student enrolled at Southwest tech, currently learning software development in Java. I am 21 years old and starting my first OOP course. 
<br>
I am taking this program because I enjoy programming (when I actually understand it) and I want to have a stable career in the future. The more I learn about programming the more I like it and my end goal of this program is to have a complete passion for software development.
